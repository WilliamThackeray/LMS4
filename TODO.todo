LMS4 Questions:
  ☐ When I send a code(422), it resends a header and my program crashes. Is it set up correctly?

  ☐ The lookup stuff is just to get the list of coaches for teh future dropdown we will us, right?

  ☐ The sorting/paging/filtering just go with the other team stuff right? 
    ☐ How do the routes look for this?
    ☐ Do I need to use the rest_storage_service.js for this part of the project? 
      (that's where the getQueryString() is in.)
